# Vanilla-JavaScript-Project-1

In the pursuit of practicing JavaScript and incorporating it into my HTML I am following the tutorial of the first 
project from freeCodeCamp's Vanilla JavaScript Course video. Said course video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=441s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).
